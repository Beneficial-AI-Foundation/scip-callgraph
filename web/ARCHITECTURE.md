# Interactive Graph Viewer - Architecture

## System Overview

The viewer consumes JSON produced by **language-specific probes** — standalone
tools that extract dependency graphs and verification metadata from formally
verified codebases:

| Probe | Language | Repository |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **probe-verus** | Verus / Rust | [Beneficial-AI-Foundation/probe-verus](https://github.com/Beneficial-AI-Foundation/probe-verus) |
| **probe-rust** | Rust | [Beneficial-AI-Foundation/probe-rust](https://github.com/Beneficial-AI-Foundation/probe-rust) |
| **probe-lean** | Lean 4 | [Beneficial-AI-Foundation/probe-lean](https://github.com/Beneficial-AI-Foundation/probe-lean) |
| **probe-aeneas** | Rust → Lean translation | [Beneficial-AI-Foundation/probe-aeneas](https://github.com/Beneficial-AI-Foundation/probe-aeneas) |

Single-probe output is an **atom dict** (see Input Formats). `probe merge`
combines outputs from several probes into one mixed-language graph; the loader
resolves cross-project dependencies and synthesizes Rust↔Lean mapping edges
from the Aeneas translation metadata.

## Data Flow

**Verus / Rust path**: `verus-analyzer scip` (or `rust-analyzer scip`) →
`index.scip` → `scip print --json` → probe pipeline (parse, build call graph,
convert to atoms) → atom dict or D3 JSON. The Rust side of this pipeline lives
in `crates/scip-core`; see `docs/technical/scip-core-architecture.md`.

**Lean path**: `probe-lean extract` reads the Lean environment and writes the
atom dict directly. No Rust processing.

**Merged path**: `probe merge` joins several probe outputs; atoms keep
`*-dependencies-external` entries that the loader resolves against the merged
atom set, plus `translation-*` fields from Aeneas that become mapping edges.

In the browser:

```
Load JSON → Normalize (graph-loader) → Full graph + crate_name backfill
          → User interaction → Query pipeline (compile → execute)
          → View dispatch → Render
```

## Input Formats

The loader (`parseAndNormalizeGraph` in `src/graph-loader.ts`) auto-detects
four formats:

### 1. Probe atom dict (primary)

A flat object keyed by atom ID:

```json
{
  "probe:fn_name": {
    "display-name": "fn_name",
    "dependencies": ["probe:other_fn"],
    "code-path": "src/lib.rs",
    "code-text": { "lines-start": 10, "lines-end": 25 },
    "kind": "exec",
    "verification-status": "verified",
    "language": "rust",
    "dependencies-with-locations": [
      { "code-name": "probe:other_fn", "location": "inner", "line": 15 }
    ]
  }
}
```

Atoms may also carry `is-public-api`, `attributes`, `specs`,
`translation-name` / `translation-path` / `translation-text`, `rust-source`,
and `type-/term-dependencies-external`. The full field list is the
`ProbeAtom` interface in `src/types.ts`.

### 2. Schema envelope

Wraps an atom dict with provenance. Current probe output is
`"schema-version": "3.0"`; the loader accepts any version that has
`schema-version` and a `data` payload (`isSchema2Envelope` in `types.ts`).
Merged graphs carry an `inputs[]` array with one `source` per probe run
instead of a single `source`:

```json
{
  "schema": "probe-lean/extract",
  "schema-version": "3.0",
  "tool": { "name": "probe-lean", "version": "0.14.0", "command": "extract" },
  "source": { "repo": "...", "commit": "...", "language": "lean", "package": "Spqr" },
  "data": { /* atom dict */ }
}
```

The loader extracts per-language GitHub source configs from `source` /
`inputs[]` (repo, commit as git ref, package as path prefix for Rust
workspace crates) so the viewer can link nodes to source across a
multi-repo merge (`pickSourceConfig`).

### 3. D3Graph

`{ nodes, links, metadata }` — the viewer's internal format, accepted
directly (emitted by the Rust pipeline's `atoms_to_d3_graph` and by
`export_call_graph_d3`).

### 4. Simplified format

An array of nodes with `identifier` / `deps` fields
(`convertSimplifiedToD3Graph`). Legacy.

## Graph Loader

`convertAtomDictToD3Graph()` does more than field mapping:

- **Entry points** (`is_entry_point`): set for atoms marked `is-public-api`,
  for their Lean translation targets (the Aeneas mapping join — these have
  in-project callers, so degree-based seeding would hide them), and for Lean
  atoms with the `blueprint` attribute. Used as the preferred seed tier for
  the seeded initial view on large graphs.
- **Link synthesis**: `dependencies-with-locations` become typed edges
  (`inner` / `precondition` / `postcondition`); edges between atoms of
  different languages become `mapping` edges; `translation-name` adds an
  explicit Rust→Lean `mapping` edge; `specs` entries add spec-theorem →
  definition `spec` edges.
- **Merge resolution**: `*-dependencies-external` names that resolve in the
  loaded atom set (after `probe merge`) become ordinary edges.
- **`crate_name` backfill** happens at load time via `extractCrateName()`
  (`types.ts`): first path segment of the SCIP/probe ID for Rust, first two
  path segments of `relative_path` for Lean, per-node in mixed graphs. The
  Crate Map partitions on this value.

## TypeScript Components

| Module | Role |
|--------|------|
| `src/types.ts` | All shared types (`D3Node`, `FilterOptions`, `GraphState`, kind sets, verification statuses). The type definitions there are authoritative; they are not duplicated here. |
| `src/graph-loader.ts` | Format detection and normalization (above) |
| `src/query.ts`, `src/filters.ts` | Compile → execute query pipeline. See `QUERY_PIPELINE.md`. |
| `src/graph.ts` | Call Graph view (layered force layout, auto-fit camera) |
| `src/blueprint.ts` | File Map view (dagre compound layout, dual-channel coloring) |
| `src/crate-map.ts` | Crate Map / Namespace Map view (quotient graph, 3 drill-down modes) |
| `src/graph-utils.ts` | Seed tiers and budgeted expansion for the seeded initial view, transitive reduction |
| `src/guide/` | Static-analysis Guide panel (graph summary, suggested queries — no LLM) |
| `src/main.ts` | State, URL handling, view dispatch, VS Code messaging |

Per-view layout and encoding algorithms are specified in
[`docs/technical/`](docs/technical/README.md).

The third view is labeled **Crate Map** for Rust graphs and **Namespace Map**
for Lean graphs (`main.ts`, `crate-map.ts`); the partitioning is the
`extractCrateName` value either way.

## URL Integration

Graph sources: `?json=` (alias `?url=`) loads from a URL, `?github=` sets the
source-link base, `?github_prefix=` / `?prefix=` set the path prefix;
`VITE_GRAPH_JSON_URL`, `VITE_GITHUB_URL`, `VITE_GITHUB_BRANCH`,
`VITE_GITHUB_PATH_PREFIX` are the build-time equivalents. Filter state,
view selection, crate boundary, `?focus=` and `?entrypoints=` payload URLs
are all shareable; the full parameter table is in `QUERY_PIPELINE.md` §7.

## Performance

- **Deferred loading**: files over 10 MiB (`LARGE_FILE_SIZE_THRESHOLD`)
  prompt before loading.
- **Large-graph gate**: graphs over 2 000 nodes or 10 000 links
  (`LARGE_GRAPH_*_THRESHOLD`) don't render fully. Instead the viewer
  auto-seeds an initial view from entry points (`computeSeedTiers` /
  `expandFromSeeds` in `graph-utils.ts`) within a render budget, with a
  banner showing what is displayed. Only if no seed tier fits does it fall
  back to the empty "use filters" view.
- **Result limiting**: at most 200 rendered nodes (`MAX_RENDERED_NODES`).
- **Debounced search**: 300 ms.
- Pre-computed `dependencies` / `dependents` arrays; nodes and links are
  cloned before D3 mutates them.

## VS Code Integration

The viewer runs as a webview (`vite.config.vscode.js` builds it with relative
paths). Messaging:

```typescript
// Extension → webview
webview.postMessage({
  type: 'loadGraph',
  graph: graphData,
  selectedNodeId: 'scip:...#function()',   // exact-match node selection
  initialQuery: { source: 'function_name', depth: 2 }
});

// Webview → extension
vscode.postMessage({
  type: 'navigate',
  relativePath: 'src/lib.rs', startLine: 42, endLine: 50
});
```

Exact node IDs bypass pattern matching (see `QUERY_PIPELINE.md` §6.4). In
webview mode the file-upload UI is hidden and auto-load is skipped. Full
protocol: `docs/guides/vscode-extension.md`.

## Extension Points

### Adding a new filter
1. Add the property to `FilterOptions` (`types.ts`)
2. Add the predicate to `TraversalPredicates` or `DisplayPredicates` (`query.ts`)
3. Wire it in `compileQuery()` and apply it in `executeQuery()`
4. Add the UI control (`index.html`) and handler (`main.ts`)
5. Update URL generation/parsing for shareable links

### Adding new node metadata
1. Add the field to `ProbeAtom` in `types.ts` (and, for the Rust pipeline,
   to `D3Node` in `crates/scip-core/src/types.rs`)
2. Map it in `convertAtomDictToD3Graph()` (`graph-loader.ts`)
3. Add the field to the TypeScript `D3Node` interface
4. Use it in the visualization (details panel, coloring, …)

### Supporting a new probe
1. Emit atom dict JSON (or a schema envelope wrapping one)
2. Add any new fields to `ProbeAtom` in `types.ts`
3. Map them in `convertAtomDictToD3Graph()`
4. Add a CI workflow (see `.github/workflows/generate-lean-callgraph.yml`)

### Custom visualizations
Each view implements `update()`, `destroy()`, `resize()`, `clear()`, and
`highlightNodes()`. To add one: create a class with that interface, add a
button in `index.html` and a case in `createVisualization()` (`main.ts`),
and register the name in the `ActiveView` type and URL handling.
